- Fixed volume where all the triangles are located
- All triangles drawn in blue
- Triangles that intersect with others, drawn in red
- There must be at least trivial lighting
- And it should be possible to control the camera by flying around the scene, zooming in and out of the camera (with the mouse or keyboard)
